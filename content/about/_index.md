I'm a lecturer in the Science and Mathematics Education Department
and a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Mathematics in the Mathematical Sciences
Department at UT Dallas. My research is in methods for improving computational
time for stochastic seismic inversion methods, which
lies at the intersection of 
applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, and 
geophysics.

I live in Texas with my dog, Gizmo, and husband, Tim. In my free
time I love to take long walks with Gizmo, read, write with fountain pens, solve 
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, and learn new programming technologies (like
Hugo, the static site generator this website was built with).
